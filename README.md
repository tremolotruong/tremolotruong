Hi there! My name is Mike Truong, and I'm currently an Astronomy and Computational Physics double major at the University of Texas at Austin ü§ò, also currently pursuing the Elements of Computing Certification/Minor under UT. This is one of my many iterations of migrated homes for my past and current projects, as my luck with a smooth-sailing GitHub experience hasn't been quite good thus far. A couple of projects that have been deprecated and long-oudated in terms of my skills and performance would not be carried onto this current GitHub rendition of mine.


A couple of skills and projects I've worked on along my Astronomy, Physics and Computer Science journey (updated as of August 2022):

- Java (4 years):
   + Processing.org: Graphics-based Java 3D Rendering, Pixel Matrix Traversal, Image Blurring/Deblurring/Sharpening, Game Mechanics

- Linux (1 year):
   + Raspberry Pi Raspbian: Discord Status and Data Report Automated Bot (Sub-Project of Keitt Lab's Biosensing Project)
   + Bash Shell
   + Bourne Shell

- Python (2 years):
   + Notable experienced modules: numpy, matplotlib, scipy, subprocess, datetime, psutil, socket, os, discord, astropy, physics, pylatex
   + Caltech's LIGO Gravitational Wave Data Noise Identification, Removal, Cleanup & Modelling
   + Astropy Cosmology & FITS Data Catalog Collection and Classification
   + Discord Status and Data Report Automated Bot
   + Raspberry Pi Environmental Sensor Zigbee Radio-based Mesh Network
   + Data Structuring & Traversal
   + 2D & 3D Object-Oriented Python

- LaTeX (1 year):
   + Caltech's LIGO Gravitational Wave Data Noise Identification, Removal, Cleanup & Modelling
   + AASTeX-templated drafts of Astropy Cosmology & FITS Data Catalog Collection and Classification.
   + "Cherry on Top - The History of a Modern-Day Anti-IP-Rights Hobby"


Outside of STEM research, I am also a photographer for the Daily Texan and the Afterglow Music & Arts magazine. My contacts are always open for commission shoots around Austin TX, US and occasionally Saigon, VN. Check my photographic works out in the links below, and don't hesitate to reach out for commission shoots! I do portrait, graduation, street, concert, journalism & breaking news coverage, and more!
